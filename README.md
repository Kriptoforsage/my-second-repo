# My Second Repository

Welcome to my second public repository! This project is another placeholder to meet GitHub's requirement for at least two public repositories.

Feel free to explore or contribute if you wish!

This repository contains a simple README file. It's my second attempt at setting up a public repository on GitHub.

## How to use
Currently, this is just an introductory repository. I plan to add more content later.
